# gjavah 
The code in this folder was taken from [gjavah](https://github.com/Glavo/gjavah). It was originally released under the MIT license.

 The following changes were made to better fit the needs of this project:
 - Convert code to Kotlin 
 - Only produce output files for classes with at least one native method or constant
 - Support more constant types
 - Minor stylistic changes to the output
 - Use Kotlin's @Metadata annotation to get argument names for Kotlin functions
